It started around January 2015 that I liked to have a wakeup light in my bedroom. I decided to make one with a Raspberry Pi 2 that I had laying around. It was one of my weekend hobby projects. For the light I used a 1.5 to 2 meter white led strip. Connected it via a transistor to the Raspberry Pi and powered via a 12V battery. The hardware was therefore quite simple and soldered on a small PCB with holes. A picture of the setup is shown below.

The WakeUp Strip, as I named it, was controllable via the smartphone. The smartphone could acces a web app that was hosted on the Raspberry Pi. Therefore the the WakeUp Strip was only controllable when the smartphone was connected to the local Wifi. Security measures where therefore not implemented. A screenshot of the web app is shown below.

Now in 2017 I decided that more users should be able to use the WakeUp Strip and a new version should be made. The most important points are that the design should be “mass” produceable, controllable via the cloud, and easy to use. So I started to make a new design and setting up this website.
